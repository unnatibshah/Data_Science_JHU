## What is data science?

Data science can involve:

-Statistics, computer science, mathematics

-Data cleaning and formatting

-Data visualization

An Economist Special Report sums up this melange of skills well - they state that a data scientist is broadly defined as someone:

> “who combines the skills of software programmer, statistician and storyteller slash artist to extract the nuggets of gold hidden under mountains of data”

## Why do we need data science?

One of the reasons for the rise of data science in recent years is the vast amount of data currently available and being generated. Not only are massive amounts of data being collected about many aspects of the world and our lives, but we simultaneously have the rise of inexpensive computing. This has created the perfect storm in which we have rich data and the tools to analyse it: Rising computer memory capabilities, better processors, more software and now, more data scientists with the skills to put this to use and answer questions using this data!

There is a little anecdote that describes the truly exponential growth of data generation we are experiencing. In the third century BC, the Library of Alexandria was believed to house the sum of human knowledge. Today, there is enough information in the world to give every person alive 320 times as much of it as historians think was stored in Alexandria’s entire collection.

And that is still growing.

## What is big data?

We’ll talk a little bit more about big data in a later lecture, but it deserves an introduction here - since it has been so integral to the rise of data science. There are a few qualities that characterize big data. The first is volume. As the name implies, big data involves large datasets - and these large datasets are becoming more and more routine. For example, say you had a question about online video - well, YouTube has approximately 300 hours of video uploaded every minute! You would definitely have a lot of data available to you to analyse, but you can see how this might be a difficult problem to wrangle all of that data!

And this brings us to the second quality of big data: velocity. Data is being generated and collected faster than ever before. In our YouTube example, new data is coming at you every minute! In a completely different example, say you have a question about shipping times or routes. Well, most transport trucks have real time GPS data available - you could in real time analyse the trucks movements… if you have the tools and skills to do so!

The third quality of big data is variety. In the examples I’ve mentioned so far, you have different types of data available to you. In the YouTube example, you could be analysing video or audio, which is a very unstructured data set, or you could have a database of video lengths, views or comments, which is a much more structured dataset to analyse.
